  "Coleslaw! Envisioning bland mounds of limp cabbage? You're not alone. But a great coleslaw can be so much more. Make sure you have juicy fresh cabbage for this one. Toss with a little vinegar and mayonnaise and you're all set. Ah, that's crisp.": "",
  "Radish Salad! There's nothing like a fresh, peppery radish. It reminds me of the late spring... my mother would slice up our fresh radishes and serve them on grainy bread with a little salt and pepper. Ah, those were the days... but I digress. Now, watch closely...": "",
  "Omelet! This is such a simple dish, but so often done incorrectly! A perfect omelet is a thing of beauty. It's a pure golden angel of gleaming egg, and I'm going to show you my secret method...": "",

  "Bread! Breadmaking can be a very complex form of art, but I'll make it simple for you. The most important ingredient is flour, of course. But before we create the dough we'll need to activate our yeast. They prefer warm water and little something to feed on. I use plain sugar, but honey or maple syrup will do!": "",
  "Tortillas! How many of you are gnawing on a microwaved convenience-burrito while watching this program? Shame on you! You might as well wrap your beans in an old wash rag. Now, listen up. Once you've tried my fresh, rustic corn tortillas you'll never go back...": "",

A little nutmeg, cinnamon, and clove will sweep you off to a land of crimson and gold...": "",

I can't say I believe it, but the meal is delicious nonetheless!": "",
  "Hey, ever have a bunch of carp laying around and no idea what to do with them? Yeah, me too. Well, I've devised a great solution to this all-too-common problem. I call it... Carp surprise. It's quite easy to make, but you'll need a lot of carp...": "",
  "Maple Bars! Ever notice how the maple bars are always first to disappear from the doughnut box? Perplexing, because your average maple bar tastes like a sweet hockey puck. Agree? Well, just wait until you try my recipe. You can really taste the forest in these bars. Okay, you're going to need real, quality maple syrup...": "",

  "This one's for you folks living in Stardew Valley. Check for spring onion southwest of town, where the river meets the ocean. You can sometimes find a whole bunch growing right out of the dirt.": "",
  "Let's talk fences. Fences are useful for keeping weeds at bay and protecting your crops. They also let farmers contain their livestock. Fences break down after a while, but stone, iron, and hardwood fences last a lot longer than basic wood!": "",
  "Woes from crows? Sounds like you need a scarecrow! Placing a scarecrow on your farm deters crows from a pretty good distance. Make sure you protect your valuable crops!^One more thing... need a bigger backpack to hold all your stuff? Check your local general store.": "",

  "Get your hands on a fishin' pole and sell your catch! Fishing is a great way to make a little extra cash when you have some down time. The distance your bobber lands from any dry land determines what kinds of fish you'll hook... as well as the location, season, time of day, and weather!": "",
  "Fruit trees. They take an entire season to grow, so plan ahead! If the area directly surrounding your new tree isn't clear, it will interfere with growth. Once your fruit tree is mature, it'll produce delicious fruit for you every day while in season. Better start savin' up!": "",

  "Here's a rundown of the fish you can only find in summer: Dorado, found in forest rivers during the day. Rainbow Trout, found in forest rivers and in the mountains during the day. Pufferfish, found in the ocean in the early afternoon. And Octopus, found in the ocean during the morning. Catch them while you can!": "",
  "Let's talk corn. It's an unusual crop because it lasts for two seasons! That's right, while most crops die when the season changes, corn lives on. You can grow it in both summer and fall. Now, get out there and plant some corn!": "",

  "Most towns have a seasonal calendar in front of the general store. It's a good idea to check on that now and then to get a feel for what's going on in the community. Make sure to check for any job postings as well!": "",
  "Fall's almost here! It's arguably the most lucrative season for farmers, so make sure you're saving some money to buy new seeds. If you haven't upgraded your watering can by now, it's probably a good idea.": "",
  "Let's talk sunflowers. When you harvest them you'll not only get a nice flower, but you'll likely get some seeds as well. You can replant those seeds or sell them. I'm sold!": "",

Shoot for high quality, high value items and make sure to have a variety as well. Fish, minerals, artisan goods, fruit, and vegetables are all good to have!": "",

  "Got any tappers? Crafty foragers known how to build 'em. You can attach them to the wild trees that grow all over. Maple trees yield maple syrup, oak trees provide resin, and pine trees produce pine tar. Syrup's the most valuable but all tree products have their uses!": "",
  "Winter's almost here. Make sure you have enough hay stored up to feed your animals over the winter, when all the grass dies out. Each silo can hold 240 pieces of hay, so make sure to do the math and figure out if you need to build any more!": "",
  "Fish Focus: Walleye. You can find this fish on rainy evenings during the fall and winter. It can be found in any freshwater location.": "",
  "Winter's coming soon... and that means your farming operations will be coming to a halt. No crops grow in winter, unless you're lucky enough to have a greenhouse. But there's still plenty to do! More next time.": "",
  "Winter... A time when all the world goes quiet.  Now's a great time to do some mining, fishing and gathering. Upgrade your tools in preparation for a productive spring. Or get your local carpenter to build something on your farm! Stock up on resources, upgrade, and prepare for the next year.": "",

Of course, there's rumors of extremely rare and uniquefish that can only be found in particular seasons, but I don't have any information on them.": "",
  "Let's talk geodes. Geodes are hollow stones that often contain valuable minerals. A blacksmith can crack them open for you for a fee.

  "Ever had the urge to dig around in your neighbor's trash? Ew! Hey, if that's your thing, just don't do it when anyone's around. If they notice you, they'll be seriously grossed out, and it'll harm your friendship. Well, unless they're into the same thing.": "",

  "Let's talk honey. No, not you, silly. I'm talking about the sweet product made by our friends, the bees. Here's the thing... if you've got some flowers blooming near your beehouse your bees can produce flavored honey. Otherwise you'll only get 'wild honey'. Pretty sweet, huh?": "",
  "Here's a tip for you adventurers out there... don't forget your weapon's special attack! Swords can block incoming attacks, which is very useful when slimes are jumping at you. Clubs can pound the ground, sending enemies flying... and with a dagger you can perform a super-quick triple-strike attack! Be safe.": "",
  "I'd like to talk about the famous Adventurer's Guild near Pelican Town. The guild leader, Marlon, has a nice rewards program for anyone brave enough to slay monsters in the local caves.
